raw_documents='Rig ABAN-III was deployed and positioned at R_7A platform on 22.07.2019 and well R_7A#1 was spudded on 04.08.2019.    \n30” conductor was pre-piled up to 145m. \nPhase wise drilling is as follows:\n\n	26” Hole Section (0-300m): \nThe well R_7A#1 was spudded on 04.08.2019 at 0730hrs and tagged bottom (sea bed) at 110m. 17 ½” pilot hole (HLB SDMM + MWD) was drilled up to 303m with RAW mud. The hole was enlarged with 26” hole opener up to 303m with Gel mud of 9.2ppg. A wiper trip was carried out and mud weight was increased from 9.2ppg to 9.5ppg. After conditioning the well, 25 joints of 20” casing (X-56, 133ppf, LEOPARD) was lowered with casing shoe at 300m. Cementation was carried out with 185bbl of gel cement slurry of 13.6ppg followed by 210bbl of neat cement slurry of 15.2ppg. W.O.C.   \n	17 ½” Hole Section (300-918m):  \nThe drill string of 17 ½” bit was run in with slick assembly and tagged cement top at 244m. Casing Integrity Test (CIT) was carried out and 20” casing was tested at 500psi in sea water and found ok. The well volume was changed over to SOBM of 9.0ppg and slick assembly was pulled out up to surface. Further 17 ½” PDC bit was run in with HLB directional assembly (RSS+MWD) up to 300m and resumed drilling of 17 ½” hole and drilled down to 919m (SOBM: 9.0-9.7ppg). Pumped hi-vis with increased mud weight from 9.7ppg to 9.8ppg and carried out wiper trip followed by round trip and conditioned the well thoroughly. After conditioning the well thoroughly lowered 13 3/8” casing (J-55, 68ppf, BTC) and kept casing shoe at 918m and float collar at 892m.  Cementation was carried out with 152bbl cement slurry of 15.2ppg and a plug hitting pressure of 1200psi. W.O.C.\n	12 ¼” Hole Section (918-1634m): \nThe drill string with 12 ¼” PDC bit was run in with HLB directional assembly (RSS+LWD) and tagged bottom at 894m (F/C top). Carried out CIT and tested 13 3/8” casing at 1700psi with 9.0ppg of SOBM and found ok. Resumed drilling of 12 ¼” section and drilled down from 892m to 958m with SOBM mud system (MW: 9.0-9.1ppg). At this depth observed poor ROP and pulled out 12 ¼” bit up to surface and further re run 12 ¼” bit with RSS+LWD up to 958m and resumed drilling and drilled down to 1634m (SOBM: 9.1-9.5ppg). After conditioned the well, lowered 9 5/8” casing (L-80, 47ppf, BTC) with 141 joints up to 1634m and kept casing shoe at 1634m and float collar at 1607m. Cementation was carried out with 170bbl cement slurry of 15.8ppg and a plug hitting pressure of 2200psi. W.O.C.\n	8 ½” Hole Section (1634-1777m): \nIn the next run, the drill string with 8 ½” slick assembly was run in and tagged bottom at 1607m. Casing of 9 5/8” was tested @ 3500psi and found ok. Resumed 8 ½” hole drilling and drilled float collar and cement up to 1632m. The well volume was changed over from sea water to 9.2ppg of NDDF mud system. Further resumed drilling of 8 ½” hole and drilled down cement, casing shoe and fresh formation up to 1636m. At this depth it was decided to cut an 18m conventional core and core was cut from 1636m to 1640m, while coring observed poor ROP and further coring was terminated at 1640m. Core was pulled up to surface and recovered CC#1 from 1636m to 1640m (Recovery: 2.04m, 51%). Further run in 8 ½” PDC bit with RSS+LWD up to 1636m and enlarged cored portion from 1636m to 1640m and further drilling of 8 ½” hole was continued and drilled down to 1672m. At this depth observed drill string stalling due to high torque. Further drilling stopped at this depth and it was decided to cut an 18m conventional core. Further run in core bit with core barrel up to 1672m and cut a conventional core from 1672m to 1676.12m. After cutting of core up to 1676.12m further coring was terminated due to poor ROP. Broke off and pulled out core up to surface and observed empty core barrel and CC#2 recovery is nil (only few broken fragments of Limestone). Further run in with 8 ½” PDC bit with slick assembly up to 1677.12m by clearing held up portion and drilled down up to 1677.12m. Further drilling was stopped and at this depth it was decided to cut a conventional core. Further run in core bit with core barrel up to 1677.12m and cut a conventional core from 1677.12m to 1684.34m and further coring was stopped due to poor ROP. Broke off and pulled out core barrel up to surface and recovered CC#3 from 1677.12-1684.34m (Recovery: 5.13m; 71%). \nFurther run in with 8 ½” PDC bit with HLB DIR assembly (RSS+LWD) and enlarged cored portion and drilled up to 1685m. Observed HLB tool gave erratic value, rectified the same but no success. Resumed drilling and drilled down from 1685 to 1765m (While drilling observed dynamic loss @ 5-15bbl/hr.). At this depth observed high torque and string got stalled continuously. Pumped hi-vis and circulate out. Resumed drilling and drilled 8 ½” from 1739 to 1777m (Rev. TD of the well) and while drilling observed dynamic mud loss @ 9bbl/hr. and static loss nil. Pumped tandem hi-vis pill and circulate out with increased mud weight from 9.2ppg to 9.3ppg with controlled discharge to avoid mud loss prior to wiper trip. Carried out wiper trip followed by round trip and conditioned the well thoroughly. After that LithoScanner + CMR-Gr log and DSI-FMI-Gr log were recorded by Schlumberger. DSI log was recorded both in 8 ½” open hole section as well as behind 9 5/8” casing. After conditioning the well 7” liner (L-80, 29ppf) casing was lowered with keeping casing shoe at 1777m, L/Collar at 1739m & Hanger Top at 1489m.  \nCementation was carried out with 65bbl cement slurry of 15.8ppg. After W.O.C. run in with 6” bit up to 1489m (H/Top) and tested Hanger top at 3500psi and was dressed.  Further drilled cement and cleared the well up to 1739m (L/Collar top). Carried out tandem scrapper trip and scrapped the well up to 1739m. CBL-VDLGR-CCL log was recorded from 1736-1489m @ 700psi in NDDF mud system.  \nAfter recording of log well volume was changed over to sea water and 7” casing was tested hermetically at 3500psi on 11.10.2019 at 0600hrs.   \n   \n1.1.	WELL COMPLETION & ACTIVATION\n\nThe 7” liner was tested hermetically @ 3500psi and found Ok. Change over the well volume with 8.6ppg filtered brine. Mukta pay was perforated in the interval 1675-1668m (7m) @ 5spf with 4 ½” STIM gun in two runs. After perforation, run in 3 ½” tubing (EUE, L-80, 9.3ppf) with 7” hydraulic packer up to 1613m and set packer at 1613m. Packer tested at 2500psi and found holding.
